Hello, I am **Mitchell Kosciusko,** I am a physics major at the University of Connecticut. I am interested in working as a K-12 teacher teaching either chemistry, physics, or mathematics. I have worked as a tutor for 2+ years and am starting work as a substitute teacher.

About Me

My long term goal is to work as a teacher either in the state of **Connecticut or New York**. I have always had a passion for education as I was not the best student, and I feel I am able to connect with other struggling students. My experience includes:

**Experience**
- **Tutoring:** 2 years at CT State, 2 years private
- **Management:** working with teens at a summer camp

# Projects: 
- **Differential Mount design with FSAE:** Used Solidworks to create 3D CAD models for manufacturing
- **Suspension Force Calculations:** Designed systems to be used by future teams to quickly calculate forces acting on the cars suspension
