Hello, I am Mitchell Kosciusko, I am a physics major at the University of Connecticut. I am interested in working as a K-12 teacher teaching either chemistry, physics, or mathematics. I have worked as a tutor for 2+ years and am starting work as a substitute teacher.

My long term goal is to work as a teacher either in the state of Connecticut or New York.
